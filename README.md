# Cloud Cost Optimization

## Overview

The Cloud Cost Optimization project aims to reduce cloud expenses by utilizing a set of automated tools and algorithms that analyze cloud resource usage patterns. The solution provides cost optimization recommendations, such as rightsizing, eliminating idle resources, and implementing automated scaling to minimize cloud expenditure.

## Key Features

- **Cloud Provider Integration**: Integrates with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for cost analysis.
- **Cost Forecasting**: Provides a 30-day cost forecast using historical data and machine learning models.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Automatically generates optimization recommendations based on resource utilization data.
- **User Dashboard**: A Flask-based web dashboard for visualizing cloud costs and forecasts.
  
## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.9+
2. AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
3. Cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-cost-optimization.git
cd cloud-cost-optimization
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Start the Flask app:

python app.py
The application will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

Deploying
Dockerize the Application: Use the Dockerfile to build and run the application in a container.

AWS Lambda Integration: You can deploy the core cost analysis functions as Lambda functions for scalable, serverless processing.
